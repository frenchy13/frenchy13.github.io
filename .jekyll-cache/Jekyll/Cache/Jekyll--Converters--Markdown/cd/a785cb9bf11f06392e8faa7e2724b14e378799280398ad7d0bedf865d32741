I"ÊB<p>Hey Everyone.</p>

<p>This started as a project where I built my own collective with the long term goal ofÂ selling a few. With university and work time constraints it was finally finished but I definitely didnt have time in the near future to make a product of a quality/finish I would be happy to sell.Â Therefor, because the Flight Sim community and in particular the guys at the Â 229th I thought I would share how I made it.<br />
This is a DIY project with the idea in mind that anyone with a drill, hacksaw, soldering iron and internet connection can build. I had originally built it with a few joins using epoxy but after about 6 months use they started to slip. I then got a friend to do a quick 2 minute weld on the one join and now its as strong as ever.</p>

<p>It does require a few semi expensive parts though (if you want it to look pretty). The 4 critical parts are:<br />
â€“ the hat switch with the coolie hat on it, ($20 AUD)<br />
â€“ black anodized panels that the switches are mounted to, ($60 AUD laser engraved, much cheaper if people buy together)<br />
â€“ 3D printed head unit that the panels are mounted to. ($50 to $100 depending on source and quality)<br />
â€“ Micro controller that interfaces with your computer Â ($30 if you are willing to upload code (which i provide) to a Teensy board, $50 plus for leo bodnar alternative)</p>

<p><strong>THE CATCH:</strong> I spent many hours teaching myself C++ code and AutoCAD to complete the files I have attached for you to use.Â If you use my files please consider making a small donation using the Paypal buttons further downÂ this page.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong><br />
<strong>Aluminium</strong><br />
For the following aluminium parts just go to your local supplier, For Victoria, Australia I used these guys:Â <strong><a href="http://www.whitepages.com.au/business-listing/just-aluminium-1264010/south-geelong-vic">Aluminium supplier</a></strong><br />
â€“ Aluminium rod 10mm OD * 120mm (needs to be solid, not tubing)<br />
â€“ Aluminium tube 25mm OD 3mm wall 500mm long<br />
â€“ Aluminium tube 32mm OD 3mm wall 130mm long<br />
â€“ Aluminium U channel W 100mm * H 50mm * T 6mm Â  Â 160mm long Â (3mm thickness will work as well, just need to be careful in construction. I was using interference fit bolts so went with 6mm to make sure they held)<br />
â€“ Aluminium right angle W 25mm * H 25mm * T 1.6mm Â  Â 300mm long (will be cut down to numerous smaller parts as mounting brackets etc)</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Buttons:</span></strong><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Buttons confused me for a bit with throws and poles, momentary vs latched etc but no need to worry. For nomenclatures sake a button position in brackets means momentary (ie will spring back to the center position when released) while not in brackets means latched (ie, will stay in position and would have to be physically shifted back to center position).</span><br />
<span style="color: #000000;">Eg (On) â€“ Off â€“ On Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â means (momentary ON) â€“ center â€“ latchedÂ ON</span></p>

<strong>4 way button with china hat<br />
**There are a few ways to do this. The switch below is a grayhill 04A which is actually used in FAA approved joysticks, I found it much better to use something of this size and quality compared to weak little ones.<br />

<p>Attached are the plans for base unit, mains shaft and friction block. The measurements are based on using KP000 pillow blocks â€“ spec sheet also attached.</p>

<p>As you will see I dont give a diameter for the holes in the top of the base unit; you should always pilot first with a small drill bit like 2mm and then expand out to the size you need for your bolts.</p>

<p>With the Main shaft hole (marked by angle hatch) I drilled the 4 corners out starting at 2mm and then going out to the biggest drill size my chuck could take. Hence I have marked the hole centers at the corners shifted inside. The fore-aft relationship between the Main shaft hole and the pillow block holes is critical for determining the angular range of motion for the main shaft. What is presented here is slightly conservative and the Main shaft hole can be filled out to refine the angle limits.</p>

<p>Also special attention needs to be payed to which side the cut out is made to allow the axle to run out into the friction block, The plans are drawn from a right perspective but the cutout goes on the LEFT side.</p>
