title: Season Over
---

Well the results of the MRI are in and I’ve done my knee properly. Fully ruptured ACL, probable tear of the lateral meniscus and I’ve fractured the tip of the femur. This means the seasons over and I need a knee reco. The worst part of it is I wont be able to get back on snow for at least 12 months after surgery �?

This has blown my plans completely out of the water. The level 3 SB resit wont happen and all the shooting plans for Japan are out the window. I don’t even know if I can go over, what will I do?

oh yeah, happy 25th bday to myself
