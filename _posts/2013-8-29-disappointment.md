The impact of needing knee surgery is really starting to sink in and is getting me down. It also doesn’t help when insurance companies are loosing my paperwork pushing back surgery dates.

I’m still at falls creek helping out in the 3-5 year old center. I’ve also been working hard to rehab my knee in the gym before surgery. The stronger I get the muscles around it know the better I will be after surgery. This has consisted of 30 minutes on the spin bike and then 45 minutes of weights most days after work.

Here’s hoping I will soon get approval to use the sit ski from the docs, they are concerned about the bumps affecting my femur fracture.
