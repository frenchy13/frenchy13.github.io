Finally getting on the snow after 2 weeks and my sit ski-skills are improving. I was able to carry my backpack on my chest and still steer with my core and the outriggers.
Kirby has decided to give skiing a go as well and has picked it up pretty quickly. We made our way up onto the blue slopes by the end of the morning and I took a couple snaps. While shooting photos from the sit ski is possible it is a little cumbersome.
