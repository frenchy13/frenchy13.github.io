title: Sit Skiing in the trees

I am on a role now that I have got my mojo back, sit skiing in the trees in 30-40cm of fresh pow. As you can see from the photos it didn't all go perfectly to plan and I must thank the Tom's and Charlie for dragging me out of the tree. I will admit that the bi-ski isn't best suited for powder in the trees, especially with the current low setup. It means I am too low and heavy in the snow to make the quick turns necessary in the trees. Without a mono-ski I will probably avoid dense trees for the rest of the season.
