It has been recognised for over 20 years that the introduction of a new digital
tool does not change students outcomes (Simmt, 1997) in mathematics. Considering
that, it is troubling teachers generally use digital tools in existing
instructional methods for efficiency rather than undergoing pedagogical reform
that results in improved student outcomes (Puentedura, 2006). As such,
frameworks like blooms digital taxonomy (Churches, 2010) and SAMR (Puentedura,
2006) have been created to help improve teachers implementation of digital tools
in the classroom.

Hamilton et al. (2016) explains that SAMR (and by extension blooms digital
hierarchy) actually encourages teachers to use technology in sterile and
hierarchical ways that results in mislead pedagogical choices. Hamilton et als.
(2016) reasoning is three fold:  
- absence of context: SAMR includes no accommodation for context; teachers
pedagogy and students learning are contextual within complex systems.  
- Rigid Structure: SAMR and Blooms digital taxonomy are deterministic and linear
in nature which directly opposes the dynamic nature of learning and the
classroom.  
- Product over Process: Technology plays a role in learning but as long as the
objectives are reached, one method or tool should not be promoted over another
just because the task was redefined (SAMR) or creative (Bloom’s) in nature.

As such, this analysis of technology use on student learning will utilise the
social constructivist digital literacy (SCDL) framework (Reynolds, 2016). SCDL
consists of six contemporary learning practices that appropriately represent the
breadth of activity common in the 21st century while recognising the
interoperability and service they provide each other rather than being mutually
exclusive or hierarchical in nature.

**Analysing and evaluating Desmos' planned implementation (criteria 5) using
SCDL**

Surf/Play – Rather than passively receiving instruction students can and will
actively experiment and play with both the Desmos GDS and during assigned Desmos
learning activities.

-   This allows students to gain an understanding of the topic at hand while
    gaining ideas for their own solutions and design possibilities. By providing
    students with scaffolded learning activities that still allows
    experimentation Desmos further permits students to form their own
    ideas/possibilities while better understanding the relationship between
    values in functions and graphical representations. Furthermore, any play
    actively improves student familiarity with the tool while catering to
    student interests and learning profile. The challenge is ensuring students
    have the prerequisite knowledge required to initially employ the interface.

Research – To better develop their understanding of the tool and possibilities
students will be encouraged to explore Desmos capabilities outside of simple
graphing tools.

-   This improves students inquiry and information seeking skills. The challenge
    here is to develop students mathematical literacy and search skill to find
    appropriate examples and solutions outside of the guided inquiry design in
    the Desmos learning activities.

Socialise – Students, through Desmos learning activities, actively share,
comment and respond to critique on explanations and solutions they generate.

-   As part of this students are openly engaging in dialogue with their peers
    exchanging ideas, feedback and providing help both through Desmos and
    verbally during activities. The problem with Desmos is that while it
    provides a portal for communication it does not limit or guide mathematical
    communication standards. As such, for improved outcomes additional support
    must be provided to students on how to communicate mathematical ideas
    effectively and correctly.

Publish – Desmos allows for the saving, posting and sharing of digital
artefacts.

-   Demos does not incorporate a revision control or messaging system outside of
    premade learning activities, as such progress tracking and editing of larger
    works becomes harder. On the other hand, adding revision control adds
    significant tedium, additional operational learning and therefor cognitive
    load.

Manage – As above Desmos does not have revision control or management tools
incorporated.

-   For the incorporation of true digital management tools you will need to go
    beyond Desmos. On the other hand, rather than implementing an external tool
    and focusing on a management product this could be used to force students to
    focus on the process. By restricting student use to Desmos it encourages
    improved (non digital) communication, planning and teamwork all useful from
    team based problem solving.

Create – at the forefront of the Desmos graphing interface is invention and
creation. The only restriction is the student’s imagination and function
knowledge.

-   Students are able to create an original idea and transform it into an
    executable project that results in an artefact of their own authoring.
    Creative tasks such as these improve computational thinking simultaneous to
    subject area learning. The significant issue is that if used alone, without
    learning activities or true experimentation, creation does not guarantee
    improved knowledge of mathematical functions and their graphical
    representations. As such, careful observation is required by the teacher
    during creation time to identify misconceptions or knowledge ceilings
    impeding further progress.
