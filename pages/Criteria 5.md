**Learning Need**

-   In the year 10 subject Mathematics B, students are required to demonstrate
    an understanding of a variety of functions (linear, quadratic and circular)
    including the effect of varying specific coefficients when written in
    standard form.

-   The time given to this topic is substantial (5 weeks with 5 periods per
    week) considering it forms the foundational understanding required for all
    VCE mathematics subjects, Further Mathematics, Mathematical Methods and
    Specialist Mathematics

-   The past/current delivery primarily consists of direct instruction with few
    inquiry tasks. It closely follows that described by Zakaria, Ibrahim, & Maat
    (2014) and Bossé & Nandakumar (Bossé & Nandakumar, 2005) where we focus on
    factorisations skills avoiding fractional and radical work. It has been
    common to observe students had limited understanding of what a ‘solution’
    actually was and general approached the topic as rote learned knowledge and
    process rather than deep understanding of the concepts

-   O’Conner & Norton’s (2016) showed, especially for quadratics, that
    developing relational understanding and functional reasoning was critical to
    deeper understanding. They propose the use of a multiple representational
    digital approach warranted considering the affordances supplied by GDS.

**Desmos – providing effective multiple representations and inquiry-based
learning tasks**

-   Not all GDS tools are equal, Montijo (2018) showed that Desmos was
    statistically beneficial to students mathematical understanding, and
    importantly, problem solving skills and confidence.

-   The inherent complexity of devices hinders students ability to access it
    successfully (Hillman, 2014). Desmos is regarded as one of the most
    intuitive and user friendly packages available to generate multiple
    representations (Banting, McCormick, Twitchell, & Harvey, 2017)

**Weekly Implementations Schedule**

Week 1

-   Tool familiarisation: Build students understanding of the GUI, interface and
    output by generating simple graphs and experimentation. Repeated modelling
    of the multiple representations available and how they link.

Week 2

-   Introduction to learning activities: Linear relationship activities, focus
    on collaboration (within and outside of Desmos) and continued
    experimentation (there are no wrong answers, just different options).

Week 3

-   Continued learning activities: Advanced linear activities, introduction to
    quadratic functions and parabolas using inquiry-based task.

Week 4

-   Continued learning activities and introduction to creation: Advanced
    Quadratic and circular function activities. Student driven image design
    draft which offers an atypical product to demonstrate learning

>   Week 5

-   Desmos art final image: combines symbolic manipulation and computation with
    the skills of creation, planning, experimentation and others. Most students
    should be using Desmos and functions in alignment with higher order thinking
    skills by this stage of the program

**Concerns and Reflections**

-   Gray & Thomas (2001) found lack of time and consistent use of GDS tool led
    to students still approaching the topic procedurally rather than
    conceptually.

-   Pierce, Ball & Stacey (2009) found that while GDS and CAS provide
    affordances around algebraic manipulation to focus on graphical
    representations this may be at the expense of future assessment outcomes (eg
    non calculator active examinations in VCE)

-   Disconnect between tools used during learning and assessment may impact end
    of year exam results if students are not properly transitioned (Stacey &
    Wiliam, 2013).

-   Cognitive load associated with transitioning from Desmos to handheld CAS
    calculator notation and a barrier to students demonstrating product during
    assessment task (Pierce, Stacey, Wander, & Ball, 2011)

-   Montijo (2018) found students easily adapted to the clean interface Desmos
    provides

-   Desmos provides short and medium cycle assessment and feedback immediately
    which is pivotal to student progression (Hattie, 2012)

-   Desmos is available at any time allowing students practice time anytime at
    school and home helping students access the learning in a comfortable
    environment.

-   Desmos does not have fixed timelines for completing tasks, all tasks are
    repeatable and can be done at students desired pace, furthermore, students
    can still access tasks if they have been absent from class.
