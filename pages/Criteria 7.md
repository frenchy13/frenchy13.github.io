**Desmos privacy and safety environment**

Desmos can be considered a private online environment when considering Elm’s
(2008) continuum for online privacy.

\-Desmos class activities are only available via class code and teacher
enrolment.

\-Students online environment is sperate to other users and confined to that
defined by the teacher and those the teacher has invited to the group/class.

\- No personal details are required to sign up, students are encouraged to use
institutional logins/emails/usernames to keep private data safe.

\- Sole provider free of advertisement material or malicious material.

**Ensuring online safety with Desmos**

As above, Desmos is a free tool designed with collaborative learning where
students can critique and share feedback contributing to each other’s learning.
In any social online environment though, negative experiences occur with over
33% of young people reporting unwanted content and contact and 21% experiencing
social exclusion or threats and abuse (Office of the eSafety Commissioner,
2018).

The eSafety Commissioner promotes improving online behaviour through awareness,
being respectful and responsible and encouraging young people to act as positive
leaders. They provide many resources that can be utilised by both students and
teachers to help build improved online safety and reduce cyber-bullying. I will
be utilising the ‘young & eSAFE’ worksheets to build understanding of the value
and expectations of being respectful online before having student begin giving
feedback and critiques within Desmos

**Ensuring online privacy with Desmos**

Again, while Desmos can be classified as a private environment there is nothing
stopping students from taking screenshots and sharing content through other
means. 20% of young people reported they share general information openly online
and 14% include personal information (Office of the eSafety Commissioner, 2018).
It is important that students are reminded of digital footprint management best
practices and awareness of how quickly information can be shared.

As above, the teacher controls access to activities ensuring they are free from
external influences and attacks. Students will only use institutional logins and
non-identify usernames in the event of a data breach of Desmos servers etc.

**Conclusion**

While there are risks for both online safety and privacy using Desmos they are
minor due to its private nature. They can be further reduced through education
and awareness programs like those mentioned above. This is not to say that a
teacher can be ignorant of the possible and must be vigilant of themselves,
their students and implement student management policies as necessary if issues
arise. Considering the learning and collaborative benefits and the low online
risk associated with Desmos it is recommended as a classroom tool.
