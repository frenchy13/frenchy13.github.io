Graphing calculators primarily separates themselves from four function and scientific calculators by being able to plot graphs. Generally, graphics calculators can also solve simultaneous equations, perform basic algebraic tasks and are normally programable. More advanced graphing calculators also incorporate a Computer Algebra System (CAS) that allows symbolic manipulation.
My chosen digital tool for analysis is Desmos.com. Desmos is an advanced graphing calculator that rather than being a separate handheld device is accessed via any common web browser and presents as an online GUI.
Desmos as an expanded product suite also offers web based basic four function and scientific calculator options, extensive online classroom activities, activity builder and simple learning management system (LMS) (Desmos, 2019).
